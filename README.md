Forest Cover Project

This is a README file for the code that demonstrates a modular implementation of a machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn.

The code performs the following tasks:
1. Loading data from a CSV file.
2. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. Scaling the features using StandardScaler.
4. Training a Random Forest classifier.
5. Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Place your dataset in the `data` directory with the name `train.csv`.
3. Modify the code as needed, such as adjusting the parameters or adding feature engineering and data cleaning steps.
4. Run the code using the command: `python main.py`.

## Code Structure
- `main.py`: The main script that executes the machine learning pipeline.
- `model.py`: Contains utility functions for loading data, splitting data, scaling features, training the model, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Customization
You can customize the code to suit your specific needs by modifying the following parts:
- Adjust the file path in `load_data()` function to load your own dataset.
- Modify the parameters in the function calls to suit your requirements.
- Add additional functions or code for feature engineering and data cleaning.
- Extend the code with additional machine learning models or evaluation metrics.
